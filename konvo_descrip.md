THE SCOPE

- The **ETP** (Patient Therapeutic Education) _aims to help patients_ acquire or maintain the skills they need _to best manage their lives with a chronic disease_.

- It takes the form of a _personalized appointment_ between a pharmacist and its patient in the pharmacy.

- The pharmacist has an important role to play in this area, as he is _the easiest health professional accessible for any patient_.

- In project, we built an **IA model** based on **BERT** in **NLP** that helps the pharmacist to automate sentiments and emotions analysis from form submitted by the patient when booking an **ETP** appointment.
